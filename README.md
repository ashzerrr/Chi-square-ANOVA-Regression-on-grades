# Chi-square-ANOVA-on-grades

This data approaches student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features, and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. 
The two datasets were merged for students who appear in both as identified by searching for students with identical attributes in each. In the merged dataset, columns with “.x” at the end of the column name come from the math dataset and columns with “.y” come from the Portuguese language dataset and is paired data for the students that appear there (each row is a unique student with their data from both the por and mat datasets).
I ran a chi-square on two factors that i think might have a relationship (family size and mother's education ).
I ran an ANOVA on weekly alcohol consumption and number of failures to see if they are predictive of G3 grades.
